# Split / Copy Path README

Adds right-click menu to explorer to split the path of the selected file or
folder and copy it to the clipboard as a node path.join call.

  `path.join('path', 'to', 'file.js')`

## Extension Settings

* `splitCopyPath.includeDirname`: include __dirname as first parameter.
* `splitCopyPath.useDoubleQuotes`: prefer double quotes around parameters.
